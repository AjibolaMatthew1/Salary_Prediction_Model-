# Salary_Prediction_Model-


This model was done to predict the Salary after giving data with the years of experience of a person.
Logically, it makes sense that as the year of experience increases the amount of salary should also increase. This logical claim was further proved by this model.
After using the linear regression model after realizing the dataset were positively correlated, it turned out to give me an accuracy of 97.9%.
